I have used:
- Java and Selenium beacuse their stability and ease of implementation with other environments 
- Testng for ease of use, implementation and it's listeners to get screenshots easily when test failed
- Extentreports for reporting, because it shows us what we need to see with a good looking screen
- Log4j for logging steps and exceptions
- Docker and Jenkins for CI/CD
- Excel for test case management, because it's easy to use and reachable
